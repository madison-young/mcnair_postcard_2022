Hi, my name is Madison and I am a third-year undergraduate student and research assistant at the University of Oregon. My academic focus is in both the arts and sciences, I am fulfilling concurrent degrees in Psychology and Spanish. I am a research assistant in the computational social neuroscience lab on campus that is investigating the brain representations of strong social bonds. However, my interests are not limited to neuroscience. I am also fascinated by educational intervention programs curated to improve individual and societal mental health. On my free time you can catch me kickin it' with my cat riffraff, going for hikes, drawing, watching some TV, or jammin to some music.
