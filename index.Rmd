I am a third-year undergraduate research assistant at the University of Oregon fulfilling concurrent degrees in Psychology and Spanish. Currently, I work in the computational social neuroscience lab on campus investigating brain representations of strong social bonds, but my interests are not limited to neuroscience. I am also fascinated by educational intervention programs curated to improve individual and societal mental health and eventually hope to get involved with this field. On my free time you can catch me kickin it' with my cat riffraff, going for hikes, drawing, watching some TV, or jammin to some music.
